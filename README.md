Resources: 
 - hyperdust - collected while idle, needed for research
 - iron: collected with clicks on asteroids, mining can be upgraded/automatized, needed for upgrades
 - tech parts: found in space rubble, needed for some upgrades
 - energy: collected through energy system (graph based usage), powers different ship upgrades

Encounters:
- asteroids: earn 1-5 iron by click, less by automining
- space rubble: earn 1 iron, chance to collect 
- rescue capsule (very rare): adds 1 crew member, dies without life support systems

Techs:
- mining (10 iron): allows iron mining by clicking on asteroids
- hyperdrive (100 iron,5 tech parts) allows hyperdrive
- laser mining (100 hyperdust): slow auto mining of asteroids, unlocks mining laser
- asteroid scanning (200 hyperdust): increased chance of asteroid spawn
- hyperdust collectors (1000 hyperdust): unlocks hyperdust collector
- hull plates (1500 hyperdust): unlo ks hull plates
- adcanced hull plating (5000 hyperdust): increases hull plate absorb ratio
- solar collectors (200 hyperdust): unlocks solar collectors
- energy storage (300 hyperdust): unlocks battery cells
- hyperdust biology (10000 hyperdust): allows sighting of hyperbeasts

Ship upgrades:
- mining laser (50 iron, 5 tech parts): slowly collects iron from asteroids, consumes energy on usep
- hyperdust collector (150 iron, 20 tech parts): increases hyperdust collecting rate 
- hull plates (25 iron): reduce asteroid collision damage
- life support systems (250 iron, 5 tech parts): allows support of crew members, consumes energy
- solar collectors (50 iron): collects minor amounts of energy over time
- battery cell (500 iron, 5 tech parts): stores some energy
- hyperbeast cage (12500 iron): allows capturing of 1 hyperbeast

Hyperbeasts:
- elusive hypersnail: consumes 1 hyperdust/tick, increases hyperdust collection by 1
-  raging hyperhound: consumes 2 hyperdust/tick, eats occasionally asteroids to earn 1 tech part
